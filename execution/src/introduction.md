# Introduction
From the damage coda.

## [Preprocessor](./preprocessor.md)
In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program.

## [Compiler](./compiler.md)
A compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language). 

## [Linker-Loader](./linker-loader.md)
In computing, a linker or link editor is a computer utility program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file, library file, or another 'object' file.

In computer systems a loader is the part of an operating system that is responsible for loading programs and libraries.

## [Execution](./execution.md)
Execution in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or virtual machine executes the instructions of a computer program. 

### [Runtime System](./runtime-system.md)
A runtime system, also called run-time system, primarily __implements portions of an execution model.__ This is in contrast to the runtime lifecycle phase of a program, during which the runtime system is in operation. 

### [Virtual Machine](./virtual-machine.md)
In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer.
