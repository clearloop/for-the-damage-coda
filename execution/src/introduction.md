# Introduction
From the damage coda.

## Preprocessor
In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program.

## Compiler
A compiler is computer software that transforms computer code written in one programming language (the source language) into another programming language (the target language). 

## Linker-Loader
In computing, a linker or link editor is a computer utility program that takes one or more object files generated by a compiler and combines them into a single executable file, library file, or another 'object' file.

In computer systems a loader is the part of an operating system that is responsible for loading programs and libraries.

## Execution
Execution in computer and software engineering is the process by which a computer or virtual machine executes the instructions of a computer program.
